I present to you my custom made PCB to assist the well known XBOX HD+ Mod

This custom build PCB is built to help with the XBOX AVIP Socket soldering locations for the XBOX HD+

If you like my design please consider donating to support my work. It takes time, effort and money to test these designs and I happy to share at no cost to help benifit the community.
