This custom PCB I built to help with the XBOX AVIP Socket soldering locations for the XBOX HD+ and to tidy up wire managment to keep things looking sleek.

If you like my design please consider donating to support my work. It takes time, effort and money to test these designs and I happy to share at no cost to help benifit the community.
